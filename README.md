# Anime Vault

This is a Nextjs, Tailwindcss project that displays a list of anime characters and their details. It uses server side rendering, API calls, and infinite scrolling to create a fast and responsive website.

## Features

- It uses Nextjs, a React framework that enables server side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.
- It uses Tailwindcss, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid and customizable styling.
- It uses the shikimori api, to fetch data about anime characters and their shows.
- It uses infinite scrolling to load more data as the user scrolls down the page, improving the performance and user experience of the website. It also loads the data in small chunks, reducing the network and memory usage.
- It uses a little bit of hover animation on the cards, adding some interactivity and flair to the website.
